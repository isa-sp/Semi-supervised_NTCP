# Self-training function with logistic regression or ridge regression 

### Description
This repository contains the code for the semi-supervised method of self-training with logistic regression or ridge regression as classifier, and forms the basis of the self-training method that was used in a study on the performance of semi-supervised learning in Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP) modeling for head and neck cancer patients:
